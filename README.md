# nn-sphere
Five layer neural network to output data to the surface of a unit-radius sphere

This project draws on code developed by Prof Bastiaan Kleijn, Victoria University of Wellington, and trains a neural network to project test data onto the surface of a sphere with radius 1 unit.  The project has code and commentary in a python notebook, developed on google colab.  Report requirements are developed and delivered using tex with RMarkdown.
